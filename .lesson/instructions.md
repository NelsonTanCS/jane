# Final Project: Employee database

### Scenario: 
You will be building a simple database program using Python and SQLite for a simple Employee system.  Build this around an existing or fictitious company or theme. You are welcome to use Pandas for some of the functions if you wish to do so. As always, feel free to go above and beyond for a more rich learning experience, just be sure to meet the requirements in this program.

Tips: Keep this simple and focus on the functionality. 

## Requirements
* Create an employee table with the following fields: (10 points)

  * employee id number - this should be a randomly generated number between 1000 and 9999
  * first name
  * last name
  * street address
  * city
  * state
  * zipcode
  * email address - this will be automatically created using a format based on the inputted first and last name
  * phone number
  * hourly rate
  * department name


* Build a menu system with the following functions:

  * Create a function to add an employee using the given inputs.
       - Automatically assign a random employee id and automatically create an email address from their first and last name. Allow the user to input all other fields. (15 points)
  * Create a function to list all employee id numbers, names, email addresses, and their department name. (5 points)
  * Create a function to list all employee names, full addresses, and phone numbers. (5 points)
  * Create a search function to search for an employee by last name. Then list all of the matches of the last name, first name, email and department name. (15 points)
  * Create an update hourly rate function that will allow the user to update the hourly rate for a given employee. (10 points)
  * Create an update contact information function that will allow the user to update the street address, city, state, zipcode, and phone number for a given employee. (10 points)
  * Create a delete function that will allow the user to delete a given employee. Be sure to confirm the username before deletion. (10 points)

## Other requirements

* You have the creative license to add to this program however you wish. Be sure that the above features are working. You can add additional functionality to the program if you would like to. 

* Do your best to meet the requirements of the project, but if you cannot get a particular function to work, turn in what does work. Do one function at a time and test. Once you know that function works, move onto the next. 

* Ensure that there is a minimum of 10 sample employees in the employee table for us to test your program with.

* Test, test, and test again. 

* Be sure to consider the user experience and the formatting of the data. (10 points)

* Comment your code and name your functions well. (10 points)

Have fun with this!
